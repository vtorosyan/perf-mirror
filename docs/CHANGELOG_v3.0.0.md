# PerfMirror v3.0.0 - Role-Level Performance System

## 🎯 Major Features

### 5-Band Performance Evaluation System

**Old System (3 bands):**
- Excellent (225+)
- Good (170+) 
- Needs Improvement (120+)
- Unsatisfactory (<120)

**New System (5 bands):**
- 🌟 **Outstanding** (300+) - Exceptional performance exceeding all expectations
- ✅ **Strong Performance** (230+) - Consistently exceeding expectations with high impact
- 📊 **Meeting Expectations** (170+) - Solid performance meeting all role requirements
- ⚠️ **Partially Meeting Expectations** (140+) - Some gaps in performance, needs improvement
- ❌ **Underperforming** (<140) - Significant performance concerns requiring immediate attention

### Role-Level Performance Targets

**New Features:**
- Performance targets now specific to role and level combinations
- Role categories: IC (L1-L6), Manager (L1-L4), Senior Manager (L1-L3), Director (L1-L2)
- Customizable thresholds for each role-level combination
- More precise performance evaluation based on career progression

**Example Target:**
```typescript
{
  name: "Senior Engineer L4 Target",
  role: "IC",
  level: 4,
  outstandingThreshold: 300,
  strongThreshold: 230,
  meetingThreshold: 170,
  partialThreshold: 140,
  underperformingThreshold: 120,
  timePeriodWeeks: 12
}
```

### Level Expectations Management

**New Capability:**
- Define specific expectations for each role and level combination
- Editable expectations through the Role & Level Setup interface
- Support for multiple expectations per role-level
- Categories: Behavioral, Technical, Impact, and Growth expectations

**Example Expectations for IC Level 4:**
- "Leads technical design for medium to large complexity projects"
- "Mentors junior and mid-level engineers, providing technical guidance"
- "Contributes to architectural decisions within team and adjacent team scope"
- "Demonstrates strong problem-solving and debugging skills across the stack"

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Database Schema Updates

**PerformanceTarget Table:**
```sql
-- Old fields (removed):
excellentThreshold, goodThreshold, needsImprovementThreshold

-- New fields (added):
role, level, outstandingThreshold, strongThreshold, meetingThreshold, 
partialThreshold, underperformingThreshold
```

**RoleWeights Table:**
```sql
-- New fields (added):
role, level
```

**New LevelExpectation Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE LevelExpectation (
    id              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    role            TEXT NOT NULL,
    level           INTEGER NOT NULL,
    expectation     TEXT NOT NULL,
    createdAt       DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updatedAt       DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Updates

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/level-expectations` - List level expectations with role/level filtering
- `POST /api/level-expectations` - Create new expectations
- `PUT /api/level-expectations/{id}` - Update expectations
- `DELETE /api/level-expectations/{id}` - Delete expectations

**Updated Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/targets` - Now returns 5 threshold fields and role/level
- `POST /api/targets` - Accepts role, level, and 5 threshold fields
- `PUT /api/targets/{id}` - Updates with new schema

### Component Updates

**Dashboard Component:**
- Updated Target Thresholds display with color-coded 5-band system
- Enhanced performance level calculation using new thresholds
- Improved insights generation for 5-band system
- Updated chart threshold lines for new performance bands

**PerformanceTargets Component:**
- Complete rewrite to support role-level targets
- Added role and level selection (now required)
- Form validation for 5 threshold fields in descending order
- Enhanced UI with Performance Band Guide
- Color-coded performance bands matching Role Setup

**RoleSetup Component:**

- New state management for expectations CRUD operations
- Enhanced UI with add/edit/delete expectations
- Integrated with new level-expectations API

## 📊 User Interface Improvements

### Enhanced Dashboard
- **Target Thresholds Card**: Now displays all 5 performance bands with color indicators
- **Performance Level Display**: More nuanced feedback based on 5-band system
- **Chart Improvements**: Updated threshold lines for Outstanding, Strong Performance, and Meeting Expectations

### Role & Level Setup
- **Editable Expectations**: Click-to-edit functionality for level expectations
- **Add/Remove Expectations**: Easy management of expectations per role-level
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear display of performance evaluation bands
- **Improved UX**: Save/cancel functionality with proper state management

### Performance Targets
- **Role-Level Selection**: Required role and level fields for precise targeting
- **5-Threshold Input**: All performance bands configurable
- **Validation**: Ensures thresholds are in proper descending order

## 🔄 Migration Path

### Automatic Migration
The system automatically handles the database schema migration:

1. **Schema Update**: New threshold fields added with sensible defaults
2. **Data Preservation**: Existing targets maintained but updated to new schema
3. **Backward Compatibility**: APIs handle both old and new data formats during transition

### Manual Steps Required
1. **Update Performance Targets**: Review and update targets to use role-level specificity
2. **Define Level Expectations**: Add expectations for your organization's role-level combinations
3. **Calibrate Thresholds**: Adjust the 5-band thresholds based on your team's performance distribution
